# developing_data_products_leaflet

In this project we will create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

This web page is hosted on GitHub Pages (https://elenakush.github.io/developing_data_products_leaflet/map_COVID19.html).

For the project purposes we will analyse coronavirus COVID-19 confirmed infection and death cases worldwide.

We used data posted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

The data is dated from the 2020-01-22 up to the 2020-04-14.

To create a map we used the following libraries: dplyr, leaflet, maps, geojsonio and stringr.
